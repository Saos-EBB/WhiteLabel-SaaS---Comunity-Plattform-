// Every hover/focus tooltip in the dashboard, in one place. An element
// opts in with `data-tip="key"` (a key into TOOLTIPS below) instead of
// inlining its explanation in markup — so the wording can be edited here
// without hunting through index.html/app.js. Written for someone with no
// loadtest background: plain language, jargon explained inline where a
// term can't be avoided.
//
// Two trigger styles, both handled by the same engine:
//   - a plain input/control already gets a tooltip on hover/focus, no
//     extra markup needed (it's already interactive);
//   - anything else that isn't otherwise interactive (a header, a label,
//     a dot, a bar) gets a small `<span class="hint" data-tip="…"
//     tabindex="0">ⓘ</span>` glyph next to it, keeping the label itself
//     clean. On touch, tapping that glyph toggles the tip open, since
//     there's no hover to rely on.

  // Mode 2 — controls
  'mode2.controlsInfo': "Runs the load test: checks the server is reachable, creates temporary test accounts, logs them in, then has every virtual user repeatedly perform random actions for the set duration — then prints a summary.",
  'mode2.users': "How many virtual users hit the app at the same time. Each one repeatedly performs random actions (browsing, chatting, etc.) for the whole test.",
  'mode2.duration': "How long the test runs, in seconds. All virtual users work at the same time for this long, then stop.",

  // Mode 2 — prefetch phase
  'mode2.prefetch': "Before the test itself starts, every virtual user has to log in once so it has something to send with each request. This shows how many of those logins are done. It only happens here at the start — once every token is loaded, the actual test begins.",
  'mode2.shortfall': "Fewer virtual users actually logged in than you asked for — usually because the test database doesn't have that many fake accounts set up yet. The test still ran, just with fewer users than requested, so treat its numbers as smaller-scale than intended.",

  // Mode 2 — status bar
  'mode2.state': "Whether a test is running (LÄUFT), has finished (FERTIG), or hasn't started (IDLE). Turns red if this run has had a real server error.",
  'mode2.reqs': "How many requests per second the virtual users are generating right now — the actual load being placed on the server.",
  'mode2.successRate': "The share of requests that got a normal 2xx success response (2xx is the standard code range for \"it worked\"). This doesn't count requests the server correctly refused — see the health bar below — so for real trouble, watch Echte Fehler instead.",
  'mode2.realErrors': "Server failures or dropped connections — requests that broke instead of completing normally. The number that actually matters here. Should stay at 0.",

  // Mode 2 — health bar
  'mode2.healthBar': "Every request in this run, split into three groups: green = success, amber = expected refusal, red = real error. Each color's width shows its share of the total.",
  'mode2.healthOk': "Success (2xx) — requests that completed normally, exactly as expected.",
  'mode2.healthWarn': "Expected reject (4xx) — requests the server correctly refused, e.g. voting twice, or not having enough coins. This is normal, intended behavior, not a bug.",
  'mode2.healthErr': "Error (5xx / transport) — real failures: the server broke, or the connection dropped before finishing. This should stay at 0.",

  // Mode 2 — endpoint table
  'mode2.colN': "How many times this endpoint (a specific page or action, e.g. \"send a chat message\") was called during the test.",

  'mode2.colLatencyBar': "A visual comparison of response time: this bar's length is relative to the slowest endpoint in the table, so the slow ones stand out at a glance.",
  'mode2.colOk': "Requests to this endpoint that got a normal 2xx success response.",
  'mode2.col4xx': "Requests to this endpoint the server correctly refused (e.g. a duplicate action, or not enough coins). Expected — not a bug.",

  'mode1.rateStep': "How much the login rate increases with each step, in logins per second.",
  'mode1.stepSec': "How long each step lasts, in seconds, before the rate increases again.",
  'mode1.maxRate': "The highest login rate the test will try, in logins per second. The ramp stops here even if the server hasn't struggled yet.",
  'mode1.autoStop': "If checked, the test stops itself as soon as one step's success rate drops below the threshold, instead of always running every step up to Max rate.",
  'mode1.threshold': "The success rate (%) a step must reach to count as \"still working\". Used to work out the login limit and the knee below.",
  'mode1.baseUrl': "The web address the login requests are sent to.",

  // Mode 1 — status bar
  'mode1.state': "Whether the ramp is running, has finished, or hasn't started. Turns red if no step ever reached the success threshold.",
  'mode1.limit': "The login limit: the highest rate (logins per second) at which the server still met the success threshold. The practical answer to \"how many logins/sec can it handle\".",
  'mode1.bcrypt': "The average response time, in milliseconds, at the login limit above. Logins are deliberately slow because of bcrypt, a password-scrambling method designed to be hard to crack — some delay here is expected, not a bug.",
  'mode1.knee': "The knee: the first rate where the success rate dropped below the threshold. Past this point the server starts to struggle — logins begin failing or timing out.",
